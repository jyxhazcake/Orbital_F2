This is an Orbital (CP2106) project done in AY20/21 Summer together with @ZenoNexus (Yap W.X. my good pal).

Warning: We self-learnt HTML, CSS, javascript, React and basic Firebase to build this app. 
No prior knowledge of proper software documentation (or even git committing standards) shown in this project.
You have been warned.

Our Web App:
CCSGP Volunteer Job Board

Our aim was to build a website with the purpose of allowing NUS students to easily view and sign up for volunteering opportunities, and for organisations to be able to efficiently post and gather volunteers, simply put.


Total Hours spent: Over hundreds of hours
Rating of overall work: 3/5
Review of work done: I think we did a pretty good job given we self-learnt everything, but we could've definitely motivated each other and pushed ourselves to achieve a higher standard. I am proud of our work but it is not the proudest I could've been. We shall continue to work hard and strive to make better apps. Peace out folks.
